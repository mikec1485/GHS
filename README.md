# GHS
Generalised Hyperbolic Stretch

This script is designed to run within the Pixinsight Javascript Runtime environment.

The script provides an integrated environment for design, appraisal and application of stretches to astronomical images.  Stretching equations available within the script include: Generalised Hyperbolic Equations; Histogram Transformations; and Arcsinh Stretches. The script also provides graphical presentation of the stretch equations, image histogram and image view.  Image statistics are presented to facilitate the design of appropriate stretches.

A comprehensive walkthrough primer is also available.

The script should be installed using the Scripts>Feature scripts... menu option in Pixinsight.

The html documentation and image directory should be installed in the Pixinsight program file directory, within the doc>scripts directory.  Within this directory you will need to create a directory called "GeneralisedHyperbolicStretch", the html file and images directory should then be copied into this directory.
